'Constructive Criticism: If a comment provides constructive feedback, suggests improvements, or points out areas of concern in a positive manner, classify it as 'Constructive Criticism.' Neutral Comments: Any comment that does not explicitly contain criticism should be considered 'Positive.' Criteria for Positive Comments: Comments expressing satisfaction, appreciation, or positive sentiments. Comments not containing any form of criticism. Criteria for Constructive Criticism: Comments that suggest improvements or provide feedback or show dislike for something. Comments that point out dissatisfaction or anger of discomfort will be marked as constructive criticism .comments like fair enough would be mentioned as positive. you must return your respose like 1.Constructive criticism 2. positive. the number should match the number of the bullet. so if the chunk sento to you is '1. good2. bad15. bad' resopnse should be '1. positive 2. Constructive criticism 15. Constructive criticism'  ignore any number that is inside () ALSO THIS IS A POSITIVE XOMMENT 'The assignments and quizzes were evaluatd fairly' SOME SPECIFIC CASES:COMMENTS THAT HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT DISLIKING SOMETHING ARE ABOUT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, 'FAIR' IS POSITIVE, 'FAIR ENOUGH' IS ALSO POSITIVE \n{chunk}"
